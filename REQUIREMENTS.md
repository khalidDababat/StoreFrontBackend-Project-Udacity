## Database

- The database consists of 4 tables: users, products, orders, order_products.
- The order_products table is used to represent the many-to-many relationship between orders and products.

## Environment Setup

- Two environments: dev and test
- ENV=dev connects to store_restaurant
- ENV=test connects to store_restaurant_test

## Security

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with pepper and salt rounds.
- JWT tokens are used to protect user and order endpoints.

# API Requirements
